  # ── Why the signature is an attrset with a REQUIRED `platform` ─────────────
  #
  # `parseModuleConfig` used to take the JSON text alone, and the tempting
  # migration was to keep that and add a second entry point that throws only
  # when the JSON declares `platforms`. That guarantee is conditional on module
  # CONTENT: a call site that forgot the platform works perfectly for every
  # module written so far and detonates months later when someone else, in
  # another repo, adds a `platforms` block. The defect is authored in one place
  # and discovered in another.
  #
  # A required argument makes it a property of the SIGNATURE instead — a caller
  # that supplies no platform gets an error at the call, before any module
  # content is read, on day one. `platform = null` is still spellable and
  # means "no target known"; see resolvePlatforms.poisonField for what that
  # buys and what it costs.
  #
  # The old positional form is intercepted rather than left to Nix's "expected
  # a set but found a string", because docs/nix-api.md publishes it and the
  # two forms are distinguishable by type.

        The platform is required because metadata.json fields can now be platform-keyed
        (`platforms` overlays). A caller that cannot name a target passes
        `platform = null` explicitly and gets a config whose platform-keyed fields
        THROW when read, rather than one that quietly answers with the base value.

            capability_module would refuse to mint a per-target token, and the call would
            return a default value with no error surfaced. That is the exact defect
            `logos::qt::LpBridge::syncTokens` exists to prevent — which is why the two
            consumer surfaces are not freely interchangeable.

            `interface: "universal"` (write a plain src/${moduleName_}_impl.h and the contract
            is derived from it) or `interface: "cdylib"`.

      # lp_invoke, and logos::LpClient above it) is ungated at every layer, so a
      # module could always make dynamic calls without asking. What the
      # declaration actually did was BREAK the asking module — hostServiceBit
      # (logos_protocol.cpp:109-111) knows only the two names above, and
      # lp_grant_host_services returns LP_ERR_INVALID_ARG on the first entry it
      # does not recognise (:695-702), failing the WHOLE grant. So a module that
      # asked for dynamic_calls alongside a real service silently lost the real
      # one. Removed rather than made inert, so asking is a build error instead.
      # The supported surface for by-name calls is LogosModules::dynamic(target)
      # plus LpClient::getMethods(), which need no grant.

# Platform-keyed metadata.json — the selector, the merge, and the several ways
# this could have gone silently wrong.
#
# A module may declare an ORDERED list of selector-keyed overlays. The selector
# is a structured triple; each of its three components is independently
# optional:
#
#   "nix": {
#     "packages": { "runtime": ["nlohmann_json"] },
#     "platforms": [
#       { "when": { "os": "linux" },
#         "packages": { "runtime": ["krb5"] } },
#       { "when": { "architecture": "arm64" },
#         "cmake": { "extra_link_libraries": ["atomic"] } },
#       { "when": { "os": "windows", "architecture": "x86_64", "abi": "gnu" },
#         "cmake": { "extra_link_libraries": ["ws2_32","bcrypt","ntdll"] } }
#     ]
#   }
#
# EVERY matching entry applies, in DECLARATION ORDER. Lists concatenate (base
# first, then each matching overlay in turn), scalars overwrite, and OBJECTS
# RECURSE — merged key by key, with the keys only the base has surviving.
# There is no removal operator in v1 — restructure the base instead.
#
# WHY OBJECTS RECURSE INSTEAD OF OVERWRITING. The first sketch of this feature
# said "scalars and attrsets overwrite", and that is wrong in a way that is
# worth writing down rather than quietly fixing. Every overlay-able key under
# `nix` is an OBJECT: `packages` is `{build, runtime}`, `cmake` is four lists,
# `rust` is `{packages, env, toolchain}`. Under whole-object overwrite, the
# headline case of the whole feature —
#
#   "packages": { "build": ["pkg-config"], "runtime": ["nlohmann_json"] },
#   "platforms": [ { "when": {"os":"linux"}, "packages": {"runtime":["krb5"]} } ]
#
# — would silently DROP `packages.build` and `packages.runtime`'s base entry on
# Linux, because the overlay's `packages` object would replace the base's
# wholesale. Worse, "lists concatenate" would become unreachable for anything
# under `nix`: no list is ever a direct child of `packages`/`cmake`/`rust`, so
# the merge would never descend far enough to find one, and the single rule
# authors are most likely to rely on would be dead text. Recursion is what
# makes the two rules compose — descend through the objects, and apply the
# list/scalar rule at the leaf where the author actually wrote a value.
#
# WHY AN ORDERED LIST AND NOT A MAP KEYED BY SELECTOR. A map has no order, so
# it cannot express "general first, specific last": `{"os":"windows"}` and
# `{"os":"windows","architecture":"x86_64"}` would both match an x86_64 mingw
# build with nothing to say which one wins. The list makes that expressible —
# but note it does NOT make it automatic. Ordering is DECLARATION order, never
# specificity: put the general entry first yourself, because reversing the two
# entries above genuinely reverses the answer, and no rule here will catch it.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. Nothing in metadata.json was platform-keyed before,
# so a module that needed a platform-specific anything declared a
# cross-platform SUPERSET by hand and let the build ignore the parts that did
# not apply. `include` names the .so, .dylib AND .dll spellings side by side
# (mkLogosModule.nix documents a name matching nothing as NORMAL), and
# `nix.packages.runtime` cannot express a superset at all: krb5 is an
# EVALUATION-time hard failure for a mingw host (its closure pulls in bash,
# whose meta.badPlatforms excludes a windows/pe host), so eight UI modules
# carry a hand-applied "drop unused krb5" commit and seven of them still have
# it. A superset nobody validates drifts — logos-package-downloader-module
# already forgot its .dll — which is why every rule below prefers a loud throw
# to a silently-skipped overlay.

  # ── What may vary by platform ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  #
  # Everything under `nix` is build-only and safe. Top-level fields cross the
  # build→run boundary, and that boundary is the whole reason this list is one
  # key long: the shipped metadata.json is the RAW SOURCE FILE. mkLogosQmlModule
  # copies ${configFile} into $out/lib/metadata.json verbatim, and the core path
  # embeds the same source file via configure_file + Q_PLUGIN_METADATA. Nothing
  # between the parse and the artifact ever writes the RESOLVED tree back out.
  #
  # So a top-level overlay is resolved for the BUILD and ships UNRESOLVED. That
  # is harmless for `include`, which is purely a build-time staging list read
  # once by mkLogosModule's stageIncludedRuntimeFiles and by nobody at runtime.
  # It is not harmless for anything a reader downstream of the build takes off
  # the installed manifest — see `topDeferred` below, which names those fields
  # and what has to land before they can be re-admitted.
  #
  # The refusals are the interesting half of this list:
  #   name / version / type / interface — module IDENTITY and the backend
  #     selection. `type` in particular is read OUTSIDE forAllSystems by both
  #     builders; a per-platform value has no single answer to give them.
  #   codegen / interface_dependencies / dependency_overrides — these decide
  #     the generated contract, hence the interface hash. A Linux consumer
  #     calling a Windows provider whose contract was generated from different
  #     inputs is a mismatch at introspect time, not a build error.
  #   host_services — a SECURITY declaration validated against a hardcoded
  #     allowlist. parseMetadata already argues that "a build-time allowlist a
  #     module could extend from its own metadata would not be an allowlist";
  #     a platform overlay is exactly such an extension vector, and it would
  #     mean auditing the Linux build tells you nothing about the Windows one.
  #   concurrency — the author owns thread-safety for "multi". Code whose
  #     correctness depends on which host built it is not code anyone can review.
  #   icon / view / category / description — pure manifest, resolved on the
  #     install machine, with no motivating case.

  # ── Refused FOR NOW, with the precondition written down ────────────────────
  #
  # These are not refused on principle the way `type` or `host_services`
  # are — a per-target `main` or dependency list is a coherent thing to want.
  # They are refused because resolving them today changes the BUILD and not the
  # ARTIFACT, and the resulting module is wrong in a way that raises nothing
  # anywhere: no throw, no warning, a green evaluation on every platform, and a
  # manifest that names a file that does not exist on the targets the overlay
  # was written for.
  #
  # Kept as DATA rather than as a comment on the allowlist, so the refusal can
  # print the precondition to the author who tripped over it, and so that
  # re-admitting a key is a deliberate edit here rather than a word added to a
  # list. tests/test-parse-metadata.nix pins both the refusal and this map.
  topDeferred = {
    main = ''
      `main` names the plugin file the loader opens. The artifact now carries the
      RESOLVED metadata, so the mismatch that used to make this unshippable is
      gone — but the reason it stays refused never depended on that:
      mkLogosModule reads `config.main` in exactly ONE place — the
      legacy-interface guard at modulePreConfigure.nix:200, which only ever
      throws — so no BUILDING core module's `main` is read for anything; the
      file name comes from common.getPluginFilename. A core module that
      platform-keys it therefore evaluates green with no diagnostic anywhere. The platform-null poison that
      is supposed to catch this only ever fires on the ui_qml path, where
      mkLogosQmlModule reads `config.main` for `hasBackend`. A guarantee that
      holds for one module type and silently does not for the other is not a
      guarantee.'';
  };

  # What has to be true before the remaining key can go back into `topAllowed`.
  # Named once, quoted by every refusal.
  #
  # The ARTIFACT half of this is done: `dependencies` and `optional_dependencies`
  # were re-admitted once lib/modulePreConfigure.nix began staging the resolved
  # document into the build tree — which is the copy CMake embeds and the
  # generators read — and lib/mkLogosQmlModule.nix began shipping it as
  # $out/lib/metadata.json. `platforms` is already absent from that document;
  # resolvePlatforms strips it while building `topBase`.
  #
  # `main` is refused for a reason that survives all of it, so it needs its own.
  deferredPrecondition = ''
    Re-admissible once a per-target value is actually READ on every path that
    ships one. `main` is not: no BUILDING core module reads `config.main` at all
    (the file name comes from common.getPluginFilename), so a core module that
    platform-keys it resolves green and changes nothing, while the same overlay
    on a ui_qml module does take effect. A key that silently means two different
    things by module type is worse than a refused one.

    Until that read exists, put the value in the base and let the
    platform-specific part be handled where it already is: a plugin's file
    EXTENSION comes from common.getPluginFilename, which is the case a
    per-target `main` would otherwise serve.'';

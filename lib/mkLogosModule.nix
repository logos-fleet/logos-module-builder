  # `config` is parsed with NO platform. It is the answer for the handful of
  # fields no `platforms` overlay may vary — name, version, type, interface —
  # and those are exactly the fields read here, above forAllSystems, where no
  # target exists yet: `selectedBackend` below, and the system-agnostic `config`
  # flake output that collectAllModuleDeps reads from a FOREIGN flake.
  #
  # It is NOT a fallback. A field some overlay declares comes back as a throw
  # (resolvePlatforms.poisonField), so reading one of those up here is a loud
  # error rather than the base value — which is the whole point: a superset
  # nobody meant to use on its own is how the .so/.dylib/.dll spelling lists
  # drifted in the first place.
  #
  # `configFor system` is the resolved answer, and every per-system closure
  # below rebinds `config` to it as its first `let` binding. That rebinding is
  # deliberate rather than a rename: it keeps ~40 existing `config.*` reads
  # correct by construction, and there is no reading inside a per-system
  # closure that should see the unresolved tree.

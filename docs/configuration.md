# Module Configuration Reference

This document describes all available fields in `metadata.json` — the single configuration file for a Logos module. 

## Basic Structure

```json
{
  "name": "my_module",
  "display_name": "My Module",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "core",
  "interface": "universal",
  "category": "general",
  "description": "My custom Logos module",
  "main": "my_module_plugin",
  "view": null,
  "dependencies": [],

  "nix": {
    "packages": {
      "build": [],
      "runtime": []
    },
    "external_libraries": [],
    "cmake": {
      "find_packages": [],
      "extra_sources": []
    }
  }
}
```

The top-level fields are embedded into the Qt plugin at compile time via `Q_PLUGIN_METADATA`. The `"nix"` block is used by the build system for derivations and CMake generation — Qt ignores it.

## Required Fields

### `name`
**Type:** string
**Required:** Yes

The module name. Used for:
- Plugin filename: `{name}_plugin.so` / `{name}_plugin.dylib`
- Nix package name: `logos-{name}-module`
- Interface class naming convention

```json
"name": "my_module"
```

## Optional Top-Level Fields

### `display_name`
**Type:** string
**Default:** falls back to `name`

Human-readable label shown in UIs (Package Manager, App Manager, `lm metadata`,
`lgx manifest`). When unset, consumers fall back to `name`, so older modules
keep working unchanged.

```json
"display_name": "My Module"
```

### `version`
**Type:** string
**Default:** `"1.0.0"`

The module version in semver format.

```json
"version": "1.2.3"
```

### `type`
**Type:** string
**Default:** `"core"`

The module type. Supported values:
- `"core"` — backend/logic module, no UI (use `mkLogosModule`)
- `"ui"` — legacy C++ UI widget module (use `mkLogosModule`)
- `"ui_qml"` — QML view module with optional C++ backend (use `mkLogosQmlModule`)

```json
"type": "core"
```

### `interface`
**Type:** string
**Default:** `"legacy"` (the value the parser fills in when the field is absent)

Selects the authoring model. When set to `"universal"`, you write only an impl
class in `src/<name>_impl.{h,cpp}` deriving `LogosModuleContext`; the builder
derives a LIDL contract from that header and generates
`<name>_cdylib_glue.{h,cpp}` (the Qt plugin, carrying `Q_PLUGIN_METADATA`) plus
`<name>_module_impl.cpp` / `<name>_types.h` (the Qt-free C ABI around your impl).
This is the model used by all C++ templates.

- `"universal"` — glue generated from your impl header, impl class is the API (recommended)
- `"cdylib"` — the module already exports the module-impl C ABI (a Rust crate, or
  C++ compiled to the same shape); only the uniform Qt glue is generated, from a
  contract you name in `codegen.lidl`
- `"legacy"` / omitted — no glue is generated at all. Correct for a `ui_qml` view
  plugin or a test-only fixture; **refused at evaluation** for a `core` module
  that declares `main`, because such a module would build green and then be
  un-callable from every consumer

> The hand-written `<name>_interface.h` + `<name>_plugin.{h,cpp}` pair that
> `"legacy"` used to imply is no longer a way to ship a core module — that is
> what the refusal above is for. Legacy `type: "ui"` widget modules are
> unaffected.

```json
"interface": "universal"
```

### `codegen`
**Type:** object
**Default:** `{}`

Overrides for the generator driven by `interface`. Rarely needed — by default
the impl header/class are derived from `name` (e.g. `my_module` →
`src/my_module_impl.h`, class `MyModuleImpl`).

| Field | Applies to | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `impl_header` | `universal` | Path to the impl header (default `src/<name>_impl.h`) |
| `impl_class` | `universal` (and optionally `cdylib`) | Impl class name (default PascalCase of `<name>` + `Impl`). On `cdylib` it is what opts a C++ module into also generating the C-ABI export wrapper |
| `lidl` | `cdylib` | Path to the committed LIDL contract. **Required** for `interface: "cdylib"` unless `codegen.rust.trait` derives one |
| `rust` | `cdylib` | `{ "trait": "..." }` — derive the contract from a Rust trait instead of committing a `.lidl` |
| `rep` | `ui_qml` + `universal` | Path to the `.rep` QtRO contract for a C++ UI backend |
| `consumer_api_style` | `universal` / `cdylib` | Type surface of the generated `modules().<dep>` wrappers: `"lp"` (Qt-free, the default there) or `"qt"` |

```json
"interface": "universal",
"codegen": {
  "impl_header": "src/custom_impl.h",
  "impl_class": "CustomImpl"
}
```

For a universal C++ UI backend (`"type": "ui_qml"` + `"interface": "universal"`),
`codegen.rep` points at the `.rep` view contract:

```json
"type": "ui_qml",
"interface": "universal",
"codegen": { "rep": "src/my_ui.rep" }
```

#### `codegen.consumer_api_style`

Two independent axes meet in a module: the surface it PROVIDES (`interface`)
and the surface it CONSUMES its dependencies through. This key names the second
one, and only the second one — setting it changes nothing about the module's own
API or its contract.

The default is derived and matches what the build always did:

| Module shape | Default | Wrappers |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| `interface: "universal"` (`type` other than `ui_qml`) | `lp` | `std::string` / `int64_t`, calling the logos-protocol C ABI |
| `interface: "cdylib"` | `lp` | as above |
| `interface: "universal"` + `type: "ui_qml"` | `qt` | `QString` / `qlonglong`, bound through the backend's `LogosAPI` |
| omitted `interface` (hand-written Qt) | `qt` | as above |

Only ONE override is accepted, and it is the reason the key exists: a module
packaged as a cdylib provider may ask for `"qt"`.

```json
"interface": "universal",
"codegen": { "consumer_api_style": "qt" }
```

That module keeps its Qt-free PROVIDER surface — the std-typed impl header, the
derived LIDL contract, the generated `logos_module_impl.h` C ABI — while
`modules().<dep>` hands out Qt-typed wrappers. Those wrappers hold no
`LogosAPI`: the umbrella is default-constructible and bakes `metadata.json#name`
as the call origin, which each wrapper threads into
`logos::qt::LpBridge::forOrigin(origin, target)`.

The reverse — asking a Qt PLUGIN (a hand-written module, or a `ui_qml` backend)
for `"lp"` — is **refused at evaluation**, by name. Both LogosAPI-free wrapper
flavours rely on something else populating the `TokenManager` their lp client
reads. A cdylib image gets that over the C ABI (`logos_module_accept_token` →
`lp_token_save`); a Qt plugin image does not — the host writes tokens to the
`TokenManager` in its OWN image, and only `logos::qt::LpBridge::syncTokens`
(installed exclusively by the LogosAPI-taking `forTarget`) mirrors them across.
Without that mirror every outbound call presents an empty auth token and comes
back as a default value with no error raised.

### `category`
**Type:** string
**Default:** `"general"`

The module category for organizational purposes.

Common categories:
- `general` — General purpose modules
- `network` — Network protocol modules (waku, etc.)
- `chat` — Chat/messaging modules
- `wallet` — Wallet/crypto modules
- `integration` — External library integrations

```json
"category": "network"
```

### `description`
**Type:** string
**Default:** `"A Logos module"`

Human-readable description of the module.

```json
"description": "Waku network protocol module for decentralized messaging"
```

### `main`
**Type:** string
**Default:** null

The entry point for the module. For C++ modules this is the plugin name without extension (e.g. `"my_module_plugin"`). For `ui_qml` modules, when present, it is the optional backend plugin name rather than the QML entry point.

```json
"main": "my_module_plugin"
```

### `icon`
**Type:** string
**Default:** null

Relative path to the module icon. **Must be a PNG, exactly 256x256.** The bundler stages it once at `assets/icon.png` inside the `.lgx` (variant-independent, so hosts can display it without unpacking a platform build) and the build system also copies it into the standalone app plugin directory. **Required for `type: ui_qml`** at manifest version 0.4.0+; optional for `core` modules, which render no tile. A non-conforming icon fails the build with the expected/actual dimensions named. Convention: `src/icons/<module_name>.png`.

```json
"icon": "icons/my_module.png"
```

### `view`
**Type:** string
**Default:** null

Relative path (from the module's `src/` directory) to the QML entry file. For `type == "ui_qml"`, this field is required and identifies the QML entry point. If `main` is also set, it points to the optional backend plugin while `view` still identifies the UI entry.

The build system copies the view directory (e.g. `qml/`) alongside the plugin `.so` in the output.

```json
"view": "qml/Main.qml"
```

### The three dependency kinds

A module can name what it talks to in three ways. They differ in **who picks the
module** and **who guarantees it is running** — not in how you call it:

| Field | Module chosen | Loader behaviour | Reached as |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dependencies` | at build time | auto-loaded; a failure to load one fails this module | `modules().<name>` |
| `optional_dependencies` | at build time | never loaded, never required | `modules().<name>` |
| `interface_dependencies` | at **runtime**, by you | never loaded | `modules().bind_<iface>(name)` |

The first two are *concrete*: the name is known when the module is built, so the
typed wrapper is generated from the dependency's published contract and the call
sites are identical. Only the lifetime differs.

### `dependencies`
**Type:** array of strings (or objects — see below)
**Default:** `[]`

Other Logos modules this module **requires** at runtime. The build system uses
this to:
1. Generate a typed `modules().<name>` wrapper from the dependency's published contract
2. Auto-resolve flake inputs from `flakeInputs` (keys matching dependency names)
3. Bundle the dependency, and its transitive dependencies, into the package

Every name must publish a `.lidl` contract, and one that does not is refused by
name at build time. Nothing is *built* from the dependency to generate the
wrapper — only its contract is read — so a module that publishes none cannot be
depended on until it does, or until a `dependency_overrides` entry points at a
definition explicitly.

```json
"dependencies": ["waku_module", "capability_module"]
```

An entry may also be an object carrying the constraints an installer resolves it
by: `{ "name": "waku_module", "version": "^1.2.0", "signer": "did:jwk:..." }`.

### `optional_dependencies`
**Type:** array of strings (or objects, same forms as `dependencies`)
**Default:** `[]`

Concrete modules this one **can call but does not require**. Same typed
`modules().<name>` wrapper as a required dependency — the name is concrete, so
the contract is — with three differences, all of them about lifetime:

- the loader **never brings one up**, and never fails a load because one is missing;
- unloading one **does not** take its dependents down;
- it is **not bundled**. Your consumers do not inherit its runtime closure.

That last point is usually why you want this. Declaring a heavyweight module as a
required dependency drags its whole closure into every consumer of *your* module,
its tests and its packages — even for users who will never have it installed.

```json
"optional_dependencies": ["modules_state", "verified_proxy_module"]
```

**Lifetime is somebody else's job.** Loading your module does not load these, so
whatever brings them up — the app, `logoscore -l`, a package manager — has to.
Write the module so it works when they are absent.

**Checking before you call.** A call to a module that is not running costs the
full protocol deadline before it fails, so bound it:

```cpp
logos::CallError err;
auto verdict = modules().verified_proxy_module.check(chainId, &err, /*timeout_ms=*/1500);
if (err.code == "object_unavailable") { /* not running */ }
```

`object_unavailable` is how you tell "not there" from "there, and it said no" —
a module that ran and returned nothing is a different answer from one that was
never reachable.

To ask *before* calling, use `modules_state.is_ready("<name>")`. It reads the
host's own registry, so unlike anything the transport can see locally it can
say a module is genuinely **absent**. Two limits worth knowing: it answers the
HOST's view rather than "a call from me will succeed" (it goes true a few
hundred milliseconds early, before the per-caller token handshake), and a
runtime whose `modules_state` feed is stale reports an empty listing — so treat
a "no" as a hint and a "yes" as reliable, never the other way round.

**Requirements.** Each name needs a flake input, exactly like a required
dependency — the contract has to come from somewhere, and a name that publishes
none is refused at build time just the same. What differs is only that building
one to get its headers would defeat the point of declaring it optional, so there
is no override worth reaching for. A name may not appear in `dependencies` or
`interface_dependencies` as well: `modules()` has one member per name.

For a target whose contract you do not want to pin at all, drop the declaration
and call it by name through `modules().dynamic("<name>")` — untyped, but nothing
is resolved at build time.

### `provides`
**Type:** array of objects
**Default:** `[]`
**Applies to:** `ui_qml` only

App-to-app intents this module can service — capabilities another app may ask
for **by name**, without knowing your module exists.

```json
"provides": [
  {
    "intent": "wallet.send",
    "params": [
      { "name": "to",     "type": "string", "required": true },
      { "name": "amount", "type": "number", "required": true },
      { "name": "memo",   "type": "string", "required": false }
    ]
  },
  {
    "intent": "wallet.open",
    "handoff": true
  }
]
```

**Two namespaces are refused from `provides`.** `logos.*` belongs to the
platform (liblogos, logoscore) and `basecamp.*` to the Basecamp shell itself —
declaring either gets that entry dropped with a diagnostic in the host's log,
while the rest of your `provides` is kept. They are reserved so an installed app
cannot register a shell or platform capability and intercept requests meant for
it. Pick your own namespace: `wallet.*`, `myapp.*`. The restriction is on
providing, not calling — `uses` may name a shell intent, which is how the
package manager asks Basecamp to open its repositories page.

`params` is optional and describes the payload you expect. It is how a caller
finds out how to call you, and the shell **enforces** it: a missing required
field or a wrong `type` (`string` · `number` · `bool` · `object` · `array`) is
refused before your handler ever runs. Fields you did not describe are passed
through, so adding one later does not break existing callers. Omitting `params`
means *undescribed*, not *takes nothing* — nothing is checked.

`handoff` is optional and defaults to `false`. It answers "does servicing this
intent **end**?"

- **A transaction** (the default) hands control back. The user acts, you
  respond, and the shell returns them to whoever asked. `wallet.send` is one:
  they came to sign something, and once it is signed they are done with you.
- **A hand-off** (`"handoff": true`) does not. The request's whole purpose was
  to put the user somewhere and leave them there, for as long as they like —
  opening a note, starting something they will watch, landing on a settings
  page. Without the flag the shell would bounce them straight back out.

`handoff` governs **navigation only**. When you respond is a separate decision
and entirely yours:

- **Respond on arrival** when there is no completion to wait for — a page you
  opened, a note you displayed. The `ok` means "I have them".
- **Hold the request open** and respond when the user finishes the action. The
  caller then learns the thing actually happened, and still is not sent back.

If you hold it open, mind the deadline: a provider that accepted a request has
**10 minutes** before the shell reports `timeout` to the caller. That is ample
for a user pressing a button and not enough for work waiting on a network or a
chain — in that case respond once the work is *started*, and let the caller read
the outcome from its own data source.

Per-provider, not per-intent: two apps may implement one capability
differently, and each is read from its own `metadata.json`. A non-boolean is
refused and logged rather than coerced, so `"handoff": "true"` (a string) is
*not* a hand-off.

Declaring is not implementing. Handle the capability in QML or the request
times out:

```qml
Connections {
    target: logos
    function onIntentRequested(requestId, intent, params, requesterName) {
        if (intent !== "wallet.send") return
        logos.respond(requestId, true, { txHash: "0x…" }, "")
    }
}
```

Intent **names** are copied into the signed `.lgx` manifest at bundle time and
from there into a catalog index, so a shell can answer "which installable
package provides X?" before the package is installed. `params` is not carried —
it is read from the installed `metadata.json`, which is the copy that is
enforced.

`core` modules cannot provide intents. That is deliberate rather than a gap:
modules call each other directly by name through `LogosAPI`, with no chooser
and nothing for a user to decide.

### `uses`
**Type:** array of objects
**Default:** `[]`
**Applies to:** `ui_qml` only

Intents this module may request. Requesting one you have not declared fails
immediately with `not_declared`.

```json
"uses": [ { "intent": "wallet.send" } ]
```

> ⚠ **Entries must be objects.** `"uses": ["wallet.send"]` parses, declares
> nothing, and every request fails `not_declared`. Basecamp logs an
> `IntentRegistry:` warning naming the module at startup, which is the fastest
> way to spot it.

`cardinality` is accepted and only `"single"` is supported today.

See `logos-tutorial/guide-intents-for-app-developers.md` for the calling side
and the six error codes.

## Nix/Build-Only Fields (`"nix"` block)

All fields under `"nix"` are ignored by the Qt runtime.

### `nix.packages`
**Type:** object
**Default:** `{ "build": [], "runtime": [] }`

Additional Nix packages required for building or running the module.

#### `nix.packages.build`
Packages needed only during build (dev dependencies).

#### `nix.packages.runtime`
Packages needed at runtime.

```json
"nix": {
  "packages": {
    "build": ["protobuf", "abseil-cpp"],
    "runtime": ["zstd"]
  }
}
```

List only what the module actually links against or `dlopen`s. Every entry is
evaluated for the *target* platform, so an unused package can break a cross
build even though it is harmless natively — a package whose closure is not
available for the target makes the whole module fail to evaluate.

Package names can be dotted for nested packages:

```json
"nix": {
  "packages": {
    "build": ["qt6.qtbase", "python3Packages.numpy"]
  }
}
```

### `nix.rust`
**Type:** object
**Default:** `{ "packages": { "build": [], "runtime": [] }, "env": {} }`

External system build dependencies for a **Rust cdylib module's crate compile**
(`codegen.rust`). Unlike `nix.packages` — which feeds the C++ plugin link — these are
passed to the `buildRustPackage` that compiles your crate to a staticlib, so a crate
with a `*-sys` dependency (a C library located via `pkg-config`) builds inside the Nix
sandbox. Empty by default, so modules with no native deps build exactly as before.

| Field | `buildRustPackage` attr | Use for |
|-------|-------------------------|---------|
| `packages.build` | `nativeBuildInputs` | host build tools: `pkg-config`, `protoc`, `perl`, `rustPlatform.bindgenHook` |
| `packages.runtime` | `buildInputs` | libraries to link: `openssl`, `sqlite`, `zstd` |
| `env` | `env` | flag-style env vars some `*-sys` crates need |

Package names resolve like `nix.packages` (dotted nixpkgs paths). With `pkg-config` in
`build` and the library in `runtime`, Nix sets `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` automatically so the
crate's build script finds it.

Example — a crate using `reqwest` with `native-tls` (needs OpenSSL):

```json
"nix": {
  "rust": {
    "packages": { "build": ["pkg-config"], "runtime": ["openssl"] },
    "env": { "OPENSSL_NO_VENDOR": "1" }
  }
}
```

Example — a crate using `bindgen`. The `rustPlatform.bindgenHook` setup package sets
`LIBCLANG_PATH` / `BINDGEN_EXTRA_CLANG_ARGS` for you:

```json
"nix": {
  "rust": {
    "packages": { "build": ["rustPlatform.bindgenHook"] }
  }
}
```

> Tip: many crates expose a `vendored` feature (e.g. `reqwest/native-tls-vendored`,
> `rusqlite/bundled`) that compiles the C source in-tree with `cc` and needs no
> `nix.rust` at all. Prefer that when available; reach for `nix.rust` when you must link
> the system library.

For deps that can't be named by a nixpkgs attr path (an arbitrary derivation, or env that
must hold a store path), `mkLogosModule` in `flake.nix` also accepts
`rustExtraNativeBuildInputs`, `rustExtraBuildInputs`, and `rustEnv` — merged on top of
`nix.rust` (`rustEnv` wins on key conflict).

### `nix.external_libraries`
**Type:** array of objects
**Default:** `[]`

External C/C++ libraries to wrap. Each entry is an object with a `name` and one of:

#### Vendor/pre-built library (simplest)

Place the pre-built library in `lib/` and git-track it:

```json
"nix": {
  "external_libraries": [
    {
      "name": "waku",
      "vendor_path": "lib"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Library fetched from a flake input

Pass the flake input via `externalLibInputs` in `flake.nix`:

```json
"nix": {
  "external_libraries": [
    {
      "name": "gowalletsdk",
      "build_command": "make shared-library",
      "go_build": true
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Library Object Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Library name (required, must match `EXTERNAL_LIBS` in CMakeLists.txt) |
| `vendor_path` | string | Path to directory containing pre-built library files |
| `build_command` | string | Command to build a flake-input library (default: `make`) |
| `build_script` | string | Path to custom build script |
| `output_pattern` | string | Glob pattern for output files |
| `go_build` | boolean | Enable Go build environment |

### `nix.cmake`
**Type:** object
**Default:** `{}`

Additional CMake configuration options.

#### `nix.cmake.find_packages`
**Type:** array of strings

CMake packages to find via `find_package()`.

```json
"nix": {
  "cmake": {
    "find_packages": ["Protobuf", "Threads", "ZLIB"]
  }
}
```

#### `nix.cmake.extra_sources`
**Type:** array of strings

Additional source files beyond the impl sources (`*_impl.h`, `*_impl.cpp`) you
list in `CMakeLists.txt`. The generated glue is compiled automatically and does
not need to be listed here.

```json
"nix": {
  "cmake": {
    "extra_sources": ["src/helper.cpp", "src/utils.cpp"]
  }
}
```

#### `nix.cmake.extra_include_dirs`
**Type:** array of strings

Additional include directories.

```json
"nix": {
  "cmake": {
    "extra_include_dirs": ["lib", "vendor/include"]
  }
}
```

#### `nix.cmake.extra_link_libraries`
**Type:** array of strings

Additional libraries to link.

```json
"nix": {
  "cmake": {
    "extra_link_libraries": ["pthread", "dl"]
  }
}
```

## Platform-Specific Fields (`"platforms"`)

Some fields differ per target. A module may declare an **ordered list** of
selector-keyed overlays, at the top level and inside the `"nix"` block:

```json
{
  "name": "my_module",
  "include": [],

  "platforms": [
    { "when": { "os": "linux" },   "include": ["libcore.so"] },
    { "when": { "os": "darwin" },  "include": ["libcore.dylib"] },
    { "when": { "os": "windows" }, "include": ["libcore.dll"] }
  ],

  "nix": {
    "packages": { "runtime": ["nlohmann_json"] },
    "platforms": [
      { "when": { "os": "linux" },
        "packages": { "runtime": ["krb5"] } }
    ]
  }
}
```

Note the **empty base** for `include`, and the Linux `.so` sitting in an overlay
alongside the other two. That is not stylistic. **Lists concatenate**, so
writing the `.so` in the base —

```json
"include": ["libcore.so"],
"platforms": [ { "when": { "os": "darwin" }, "include": ["libcore.dylib"] } ]
```

— resolves on darwin to `["libcore.so", "libcore.dylib"]`: a cross-platform
superset, which is the exact thing this feature exists to eliminate. `libcore.so`
is not a default that darwin happens to add to, it is the **Linux value**, so it
belongs in the Linux overlay. A value belongs in the base only when it is
genuinely correct on every target.

The base still carries everything that does not vary — `nix.packages.runtime`
above keeps `nlohmann_json` on all targets and gains `krb5` on Linux only.

### The selector (`when`)

| Key | Reachable values |
|---|---|
| `os` | `linux`, `darwin`, `windows` |
| `architecture` | `x86_64`, `aarch64` |
| `abi` | `gnu`, `unknown` |

Each key is **independently optional**: `os` alone selects every architecture on
that OS, `architecture` alone selects that architecture everywhere, and all
three together name one variant. An **empty `when` is an error** — an overlay
that matched everything would just be the base config.

Common aliases are accepted and canonicalised: `arm64` → `aarch64`, `macos` →
`darwin`, `win32` → `windows`. **An unrecognised or unreachable value is an
error, not a non-match** — a selector that could never fire is always a bug, and
finding it at eval time is the entire point of the feature.

Two things about `abi` are worth knowing before you use it:

* The Windows target is **mingw** (`x86_64-w64-mingw32`), so its `abi` is `gnu`,
  not `msvc`.
* Because of that, `abi` is **not** an OS discriminator: `{"abi": "gnu"}` alone
  matches x86_64-linux, aarch64-linux **and** the Windows cross. Say
  `{"os": "windows"}` if that is what you mean.

### How overlays merge

**Every** matching overlay applies, in **declaration order**:

| Shape | Rule |
|---|---|
| list | base ++ overlay₁ ++ overlay₂ … (**no dedup**) |
| scalar (string/number/bool) | last matching overlay wins |
| object | merged key by key; base-only keys survive |
| `null` in an overlay | **error** — there is no removal operator; restructure the base |
| type mismatch with the base | **error** |

Objects **recurse** rather than overwrite, and that is worth being explicit
about because "scalars and objects overwrite" is the simpler rule and it is the
wrong one. Every overlay-able key under `nix` *is* an object — `packages` is
`{build, runtime}`, `cmake` is four lists, `rust` is `{packages, env,
toolchain}` — so whole-object overwrite would make

```json
"packages": { "build": ["pkg-config"], "runtime": ["nlohmann_json"] },
"platforms": [ { "when": {"os":"linux"}, "packages": { "runtime": ["krb5"] } } ]
```

silently **drop** `packages.build` and the base `runtime` entry on Linux. It
would also make "lists concatenate" unreachable for the whole `nix` block: no
list is ever a direct child of `packages`/`cmake`/`rust`, so the merge would
never descend far enough to meet one. Recursion is what lets the two rules
compose — descend through the objects, apply the list/scalar rule at the leaf
where the author actually wrote a value.

Ordering is **declaration** order, never specificity. Write the general entry
first and the specific one last — reversing these two genuinely reverses the
answer, and nothing will warn you:

```json
"nix": {
  "platforms": [
    { "when": { "os": "windows" }, "rust": { "toolchain": "1.95.0" } },
    { "when": { "os": "windows", "architecture": "x86_64", "abi": "gnu" },
      "rust": { "toolchain": "1.96.0" } }
  ]
}
```

### What may vary by platform

| Level | Fields |
|---|---|
| top level | `include` |
| inside `nix` | `packages`, `external_libraries`, `cmake`, `rust` |

Anything else is refused, and the refusals are deliberate:

* `name`, `version`, `type`, `interface` are module **identity** and select the
  build backend — they are read before a target is even chosen.
* `codegen`, `interface_dependencies`, `dependency_overrides` decide the
  generated **contract**. A Linux consumer calling a Windows provider built from
  a different contract is an interface-hash mismatch at runtime.
* `host_services` is a **security** declaration checked against a hardcoded
  allowlist. A privilege set that varies by platform means auditing one build
  tells you nothing about the other.
* `concurrency` — the author owns thread safety for `"multi"`; correctness must
  not depend on which host produced the binary.
* `icon`, `view`, `category`, `description` are pure manifest fields resolved on
  the installing machine.

`main` and `dependencies` are refused for a **different** reason, and the
distinction matters if you were about to work around it: they are not refused on
principle — a per-target `main` is a coherent thing to want — but because
resolving them today would change the **build** and not the **shipped module**.

The metadata.json that ships is the **source file, copied verbatim**:
`mkLogosQmlModule` does `cp <configFile> $out/lib/metadata.json`, and the core
path embeds the same source file via `configure_file` + `Q_PLUGIN_METADATA`.
Nothing between the parse and the artifact ever writes the resolved tree back
out. So a platform-keyed `main` would build one plugin and ship a manifest naming
another; and a platform-keyed `dependencies` would be resolved for the flake
inputs while the `LogosModules` umbrella — generated at build time by
`logos-plugin-qt/lib/buildPlugin.nix` straight out of the raw `dependencies`
array in that file — carried the base list, so an overlay-added dependency would
be built and linked and then have no member on `modules()`.

Both become admissible once the build tree carries the resolved tree: the jq
stamp in `lib/modulePreConfigure.nix` (the one that already splices
`logos_protocol_version` in) also splicing the resolved values and doing
`del(.platforms)`, and `mkLogosQmlModule` copying that stamped file rather than
the source. Until then, put the value in the base — a plugin's file **extension**
is already handled centrally by `common.getPluginFilename`, which is the case a
per-target `main` would otherwise serve.

`nix.external_libraries` is a list of **objects folded by `name`**. Overlays
concatenate, so declaring the same `name` in both the base and a matching
overlay is refused — move the whole entry into the overlays that want it.

### Caveats

* A `platforms` key is read from **exactly two places**: the top level and
  `nix`. Writing one anywhere else — `nix.packages.platforms`,
  `nix.rust.platforms`, inside an `external_libraries` entry — is a **hard
  error** naming the path, rather than an overlay that is quietly skipped.
* `include` is safe to platform-key because it is purely a build-time staging
  list, read once by `mkLogosModule` and by nothing at runtime. The shipped
  manifest still contains the unresolved `include` and the `platforms` list
  itself; no runtime reader looks at either.
* `nix.cmake.*` is parsed and resolved but **not yet consumed by any build
  code**. A `cmake.extra_link_libraries` overlay configures nothing today.

## Complete Example

A chat module that depends on waku, uses protobuf, and exposes its API to other modules:

```json
{
  "name": "chat",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "core",
  "interface": "universal",
  "category": "messaging",
  "description": "Chat module using Waku for decentralized messaging",
  "main": "chat_plugin",
  "dependencies": ["waku_module"],

  "nix": {
    "packages": {
      "build": ["protobuf", "abseil-cpp"],
      "runtime": ["zstd"]
    },
    "external_libraries": [],
    "cmake": {
      "find_packages": ["Protobuf", "Threads"],
      "extra_sources": ["src/chat_api.cpp", "src/chat_api.h"],
      "extra_include_dirs": [],
      "extra_link_libraries": []
    }
  }
}
```

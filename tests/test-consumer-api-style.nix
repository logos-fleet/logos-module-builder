# The CONSUMER axis: `codegen.consumer_api_style`, and the gate on it.
#
# What is being pinned here is not "the key parses". It is the boundary the key
# is allowed to cross, which is a SAFETY boundary rather than a typing one:
#
#   A generated consumer wrapper that holds no LogosAPI (the lp wrappers, and
#   the Qt wrappers emitted under `--binding origin`) can only authenticate its
#   outbound calls if something else populates the TokenManager its lp client
#   reads. In a cdylib provider image that happens over the module-impl C ABI
#   (`logos_module_accept_token` -> `lp_token_save`). In a Qt PLUGIN image it
#   does not: the host writes tokens to the TokenManager in its OWN image, and
#   the only thing that mirrors them across is logos::qt::LpBridge::syncTokens,
#   installed exclusively by `forTarget(api, ...)`.
#
#   So the same "no LogosAPI" wrapper is correct in one image and silently
#   unauthenticated in the other — calls come back as default values with no
#   error raised. `packaged_as_cdylib` is the predicate that separates them, and
#   these cases are the record of where it falls.
#
# Every default below must equal what logos-plugin-qt buildPlugin.nix derived
# before this key existed, or every module in the tree rebuilds.

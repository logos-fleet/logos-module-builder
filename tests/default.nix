# Nothing here COMPILES anything — the derivation below is an echo — but "pure
# Nix evaluation" is no longer the whole truth either: test-platform-triples.nix
# instantiates all five package sets in common.systems, the x86_64-windows mingw
# cross among them, because the platform table it checks is only worth having if
# something pins it to what a real package set reports. So this check evaluates
# nixpkgs five times and is correspondingly slower than the rest; the other test
# files are still pure evaluation over metadata.

# Usage: nix build .#checks.<system>.default

  # `builtins.deepSeq` does not force a LAMBDA — it forces to WHNF and a lambda
  # is already there — so a partially applied assertion is a perfectly good list
  # element that asserts nothing and still counts toward the total printed
  # below. That is not hypothetical: `assertBool "interface universal" (...)`
  # sat in test-parse-metadata.nix missing its third argument, evaluating to a
  # lambda, reported as a passing test, for as long as the file has existed. A
  # test suite whose failure mode is "silently shrinks" is worse than a smaller
  # suite, because the number at the end is what everyone reads.
  #
  # So each element must be a bool AND must be true. assertEq/assertBool/
  # assertThrows already throw on failure and return `true`, so a `false` here
  # means someone put a raw comparison in the list — also worth catching.

"""Compare the two independent declarations of a Qt plugin interface.

A view module and the host that loads it each declare `LogosViewPlugin` and
`LogosViewReplicaFactory` in their own header, and they meet at runtime only
through the IID string:

  module side  logos-view-module/cmake/LogosView{PluginBase,ReplicaFactory}.h.in
  host side    logos-view-module-runtime/include/LogosView{Plugin,ReplicaFactory}.h

They cannot share a header. A module plugin has to compile against Qt alone,
and the two repos have no edge between them in either direction —
logos-view-module is a leaf, and logos-view-module-runtime does not input it —
so an include could not be written even if one were wanted. So the copies
stay — but a disagreement between them is silent at every stage: both sides
compile, the plugin loads, `qobject_cast` returns nullptr and the view never
appears.

WHAT BINDS THE TWO SIDES, and therefore what this script compares
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Three separate strings have to line up, not one, and they live in three
different places:

  1. `#define <Name>_iid "..."`            — the literal, on both sides.
  2. `Q_DECLARE_INTERFACE(<Name>, <iid>)`  — what `qobject_cast<Name*>` on the
     HOST compares against. Its argument is resolved through the #defines,
     because `Q_DECLARE_INTERFACE(X, "literal")` is just as legal as
     `Q_DECLARE_INTERFACE(X, X_iid)` and only the resolved value matters.
  3. `Q_PLUGIN_METADATA(IID <iid>)` on the CONCRETE plugin class — what
     `QPluginLoader` reads out of the built binary, and the one an earlier
     version of this guard never looked at. Together with `Q_INTERFACES(...)`
     on that same class it is the entire runtime binding; the abstract class
     above it is only a compile-time shape.

An earlier version of this script read (1) and the `virtual ...;` list inside
`class <Name>`, and nothing else. Both of the mutations that actually break a
running view land outside that window and it stayed green through both:

    Q_PLUGIN_METADATA(IID LogosViewReplicaFactory_iid)
  → Q_PLUGIN_METADATA(IID "logos.view.replica_factory/2.0")
        the built plugin advertises /2.0 while the host looks for /1.0

    Q_INTERFACES(LogosViewReplicaFactory)  deleted
        moc emits no qt_metacast entry, qobject_cast returns nullptr

So the concrete classes are inspected too. For each class in the module-side
file that names the interface in its base clause, this script checks that it
still declares the interface to moc (`Q_INTERFACES`), that it is still a moc
class at all when it derives from QObject (`Q_OBJECT`), and that whatever IID
it exports through `Q_PLUGIN_METADATA` resolves to the IID the host casts on.

It also fails when it cannot find what it is looking for — a renamed class, a
missing `#define`, a base class dropped from the interface, or a module-side
file that no longer implements the interface it declares — so that erasing the
subject of a comparison is a failure rather than a vacuous pass.

# Tests for modulePreConfigure.nix — the codegen selected per `interface`.
#
# The case that matters here is the RETIRED one. `autoCodegen` ends in a
# catch-all `else ""`, so an interface it does not recognise generates no glue
# at all: the module compiles green and is then un-callable from every
# consumer, with nothing in the log to say why. `interface: "provider"` was
# removed (its `logos-cpp-generator --provider-header` dispatch is gone), so it
# has to hit an explicit throw rather than that silent no-op.
